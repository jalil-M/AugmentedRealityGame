# Augmented Reality Game

In this project, we fully created a 3d-game controlled physically, via a tangible interface (Augmented Reality).
The goal here was to touch every obstacles with a ball controled by a real object in front of our webcam.

The project was done using two softwares :
  - Processing (for the physics)
  - Blender (for the visual)
  
Please contact if you have any further questions.
Thank you in advance for time !
